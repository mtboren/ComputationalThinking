## Computational Thinking

Some things on the topic of thinking computationally:

- *What* do we want to do?
- _then_ think about the *how*, to include how to encapsulate actions in code, to increase precision, accuracy, portability, and reduce error to near zero
- maximize reusability, maintainability, flexibility
