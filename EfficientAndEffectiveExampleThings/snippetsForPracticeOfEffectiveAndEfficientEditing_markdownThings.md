## Do some Things!
We will:  Maximize clip/cut/paste/insert efficiency (minimize low lever operations)

- duplicate line without cluttering clipboard
- smart insert full line from clipboard (without need to "make room" for item being inserted)
- move line/selection up/down (move whole ordered sublist to different unordered list item parent)
- Italicize something (smart wrap w/ underscores)

## Some Super Important stuff and things

- unordered list item here (but sub list needs addtional item, and should actually be on other unordered list item)
- another unordered list item here

## And, then, we have other stuff:

Some ordered list with important steps of the thought process (_in wrong order, though; can smart cut (no selection) and smart insert paste (no need to "make room"), or can just use `Alt+Up` or `Alt+Down` to move the given line up/down_)

0. Identify the want / what (scope, definition of success -- desired outcome)
0. Theorize some "hows"
0. Consider existing solutions -- anything that will already satisfy the need?
0. Check for existing code/project for solution
    - Modify such code -- `crunch the code`
0. Else, write something
    - `crunch code from scratch`
0. Debug
0. Test
0. Iterate
0. Deliver the solution
0. Make fortune, get [Swiss account](https://bankoftheinterweb.com)
